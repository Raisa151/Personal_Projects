Details:
This is a "Heart Diseases Classification" project usinf Machine Learning. Here I have used 3 classification models and make comparison among them.
1. Support Vector Machine
2. Logistic Regression
3. Random Forest Classsifier

Dataset:
The datset is collected from Kaggle. The link is given below.
Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset

Attributes:
1. age
2. sex
3. chest pain type (4 values) -> cp
4. resting blood pressure -> trestbps
5. serum cholestoral in mg/dl -> chol
6. fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl -> fbs
7.resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2) -> restecg
8. maximum heart rate achieved -> thalach
9. exercise induced angina  -> exang
10. oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest -> oldpeak
11. the slope of the peak exercise ST segment  -> slope
12. number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy  -> ca
13. thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect  -> thal

Labels:
0 -> no heart diseas
1 -> heart disease
