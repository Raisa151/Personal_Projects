Detail:
Brain Tumor Detection using Convolution Neural Network (CNN).

Dataset:
The dataset is MRI images which is collected from kaggle.
LinK: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection

Classes:
There are 155 MRI images with Brain Tumor and 98 images without any tumor.

Classifier:
First we have built a CNN model and find an accuracy around 83%.
To increase the accurac we used Transfer Learning with ResNet architechture which gave us an accuracy of almost 95%.
