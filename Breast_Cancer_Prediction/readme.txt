Details:
A simple project of Breast Cancer Classification. First I have used Logistic Regression model to make the prediction. Then I have built a simple 
Neural Network model of only 3 layers to make prediction on the same dataset. The dataste is very simple so both models yeild almost similar results.
This is a simple preject that I did to practice how to make simple neural network model.

Dataset:

The data is derived from a test called Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA). The dataset is available in sklearn dataset. Also available in Kaggle.

[ Fine Needle Aspiration: Fine needle aspiration is a type of biopsy procedure. In fine needle aspiration, a thin needle is inserted into an area of 
abnormal-appearing tissue or body fluid. As with other types of biopsies, the sample collected during fine needle aspiration can help make a diagnosis 
or rule out conditions such as cancer. Fine needle aspiration is generally considered a safe procedure. Complications are infrequent.
