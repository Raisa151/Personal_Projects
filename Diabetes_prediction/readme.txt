Details: 
This is a Machine Learning project that can predict whether a person has diabetes or not. 
This project is done in Python. In this project, I have used Support Vector Machine model for the prediction.
This is a simple project I built to practice basic steps of ML.

Dataset:
The dataset is "Pima Indians Diabetes Database". It is collected from kaggle.

0 means 'Does not have Diabetes'.
1 means 'Has Diabetes'.
