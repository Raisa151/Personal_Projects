# Personal_Projects
Projects I made to practice knowledge of machine Learning. These are very simple projects. Main objective is to learn the basic of ML and explore different libraries.
Mostly done using simple classifiers like SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree Classifiers and simple Neural Network.

Also I have done popular image classification problems on public dataset like Brain Tumor classification and Lung segmentation etc.
Objective of those projects are to learn the basic concepts of image processing, CNN, MONAI, Transfer Learning etc.
