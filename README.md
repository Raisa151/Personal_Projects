Projects I made to practice knowledge of machine Learning. These are very simple projects. Main objective is to learn the basic of ML and explore different libraries.
Mostly done using simple classifiers like SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree Classifiers and simple Neural Network.
